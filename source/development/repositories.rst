============
Repositories
============

The repositories are managed via the ``github-manager`` (https://github.com/osism/github-manager).

For each repository there is a file in ``orgs/osism/repositories`` with the name of the repository.

This file contains a dictionary, again with the name of the repository as key.

This allows new repositories to be added or modified within the ``osism`` organization.

To remove a repository the corresponding file is removed. Afterwards, the repository is removed manually.
