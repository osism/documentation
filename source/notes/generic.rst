   ``Inspect the script. You never blindly run scripts you downloaded from the Internet, do you?``

.. note::

   Run the current kernel and install ``amd-microcode`` or ``intel-microcode`` package.

.. code-block:: console

   $ curl -L https://meltdown.ovh -o spectre-meltdown-checker.sh
   $ chmod +x spectre-meltdown-checker.sh

Deleting all partitions
=======================

.. code-block:: console

   $ sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdc bs=512 count=1 conv=notrunc

ssh: Too many authentication failures
=====================================

Description
-----------

.. code-block:: console

   $ ssh -i id_rsa.operator dragon@10.11.12.13
      Received disconnect from 10.11.12.13 port 22:2: Too many authentication failures
      Authentication failed.

Solution
--------

Sometimes this is caused by too many files in ``~/.ssh/``. You can use the ``IdentitiesOnly`` option as a workaround.

.. code-block:: console

   $ ssh -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -i id_rsa.operator dragon@10.11.12.13
