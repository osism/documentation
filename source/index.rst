============================================
Open Source Infrastructure & Service Manager
============================================

The Open Source Infrastructure & Service Manager (OSISM) is an Ansible &
Docker based deployment framework for managing OpenStack, Ceph, and necessary
services.

Further details about OSISM can be found on https://www.osism.de. Do not hesitate
to write an e-mail to info@betacloud-solutions.de if you have questions or doubts.

A testbed of OSISM is available under https://github.com/osism/testbed.
Documentation is available at https://docs.osism.de/testbed. This
allows you to deploy a small environment with four nodes on a public cloud like our
`Betacloud <https://www.betacloud.de>`_. Other providers like Citycloud are also
supported.

* **OpenStack** is a cloud operating system that controls large pools of
  compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter, all managed
  through a dashboard that gives administrators control while empowering their users
  to provision resources through a web interface. [#]_

* **Ceph** uniquely delivers object, block, and file storage in one unified system. [#]_

* **Ansible** is a simple, agentless and powerful open source IT automation. [#]_

* **Docker** provides a way to run applications securely isolated in a container,
  packaged with all its dependencies and libraries. [#]_
