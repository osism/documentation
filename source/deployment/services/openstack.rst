Clients
=======

* OpenStackClient (aka OSC) is a command-line client for OpenStack that brings the command set for Compute,
  Identity, Image, Object Storage and Block Storage APIs together in a single shell with a uniform command
  structure.

  .. code-block:: console

     $ osism-infrastructure helper --tags openstackclient

* phpMyAdmin is a free software tool written in PHP, intended to handle the administration of MySQL over
  the Web.

  .. code-block:: console

     $ osism-infrastructure helper --tags phpmyadmin
.. contents::
   :local:

Deploying Openstack Services
============================

The deployment of a single Openstack service is done using Kolla via the
``osism-kolla`` wrapper.

.. code-block:: console

   $ osism-kolla deploy SERVICE

Depending on the available bandwidth, it may be a good idea to pull the Docker
images in advance prior to deployment. This can be done with ``osism-kolla pull SERVICE``.
