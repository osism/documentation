Cluster start and stop
======================

Stop
----

Ensure that any services using RabbitMQ are stopped.

Stop the ``rabbitmq`` container on all controller nodes (one by one) and note the order of the nodes.

.. code-block:: console

   docker stop rabbitmq

Start
-----

Successively start the ``rabbitmq`` container on all controller nodes (one by one) in the reverse order.

.. code-block:: console

   docker start rabbitmq

Check
-----

.. code-block:: console

   docker exec -it rabbitmq rabbitmqctl cluster_status
   Cluster status of node 'rabbit@testbed-node-1'
   [{nodes,[{disc,['rabbit@testbed-node-0','rabbit@testbed-node-1']}]},
    {running_nodes,['rabbit@testbed-node-0','rabbit@testbed-node-1']},
    {cluster_name,<<"rabbit@testbed-node-0.osism.local">>},
    {partitions,[]},
    {alarms,[{'rabbit@testbed-node-0',[]},{'rabbit@testbed-node-1',[]}]}]

Emptying the notification queues
================================

If notifications of individual services are activated and these notifications are not consumed,
for example by Panko, over the course of time many unprocessed messages accumulate on the
individual notification queues.

.. code-block:: console

   docker exec -it rabbitmq rabbitmqctl list_queues | grep -v $'\t0'
   Listing queues
   versioned_notifications.info    2983
   versioned_notifications.error   29

.. code-block:: console

   docker exec -it rabbitmq rabbitmqctl purge_queue versioned_notifications.info
   Purging queue 'versioned_notifications.info' in vhost '/'

rabbitmqadmin
=============

https://www.rabbitmq.com/management-cli.html

The management plugin ships with a command line tool rabbitmqadmin which can perform
some of the same actions as the Web-based UI, and which may be more convenient for
automation tasks. Note that rabbitmqadmin is just a specialised HTTP client; if you
are contemplating invoking rabbitmqadmin from your own program you may want to 
consider using an HTTP API client library instead.

.. code-block:: console

   curl -o rabbitmqadmin http://api-int.osism.local:15672/cli/rabbitmqadmin

Cluster status
==============

.. code-block:: console

   docker exec -it rabbitmq rabbitmqctl eval 'rabbit_clusterer:status().'
   Rabbit is running in cluster configuration:
   [{node_ids,[{'rabbit@testbed-node-0',<<33,223,136,84,52,55,149,250,118,202,
                                          103,22,88,214,60,236>>},
               {'rabbit@testbed-node-1',<<186,47,70,175,150,251,92,174,244,196,
                                          192,37,25,113,247,124>>}]},
    {gospel,{node,'rabbit@testbed-node-0'}},
    {nodes,[{'rabbit@testbed-node-0',disc},{'rabbit@testbed-node-1',disc}]},
    {version,1}]
   Running nodes: ['rabbit@testbed-node-0','rabbit@testbed-node-1']
   ok

Broken queue
============

.. code-block:: console

   2020-03-20 17:24:44.846 6 ERROR oslo_service.service MessageDeliveryFailure: Unable to connect to AMQP server on 10.49.20.11:5672 after None tries: Queue.declare: (404) NOT_FOUND - failed to perform operation on queue 'dhcp_agent.30-02' in vhost '/' due to timeout

Stop the service, delete the queue and start the service.

Set number of Erlang schedulers
===============================

Schedulers in the runtime assign work to kernel threads that perform it. By
default the runtime will start one scheduler for one CPU core it detects. This
can lead to permanent high CPU utilisation. Setting the number of schedulers to
a lower value, will decrease CPU utilisation considerably.

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: environments/kolla/configuration.yml

   rabbitmq_server_additional_erl_args: "+S 1:1"

See `RabbitMQ documentation <https://www.rabbitmq.com/runtime.html>`_ for more
details.

Unsynchronized queues
=====================

Due to server crashes or rabbitmq container restarts there might be
unsynchronized queues. To verify this open the web console for RabbitMQ via
`<https://api-int.osism.local:15672>`_ and switch to the Queues tab. In the
nodes column you see the master node for that queue as well as the number of
synchronized (and if the case in red) the unsynchronized mirrors for that
queue. If you happen to have unsynchronized queues, click on the queue and you
should see a button to force synchronization. After that you should see the 
same number of synchronized mirrors for all queues.

To check via CLI you can use this command and check that ``slave_pids`` and 
``synchronized_slave_pids`` are identical and also contain ``cluster_size - 1``
number of entries.

.. code-block:: console

   docker exec -it rabbitmq rabbitmqctl list_queues name policy slave_pids synchronised_slave_pids


Queues missing mirrors
======================

From time to time (especially after provisioning new RabbitMQ nodes or after
reboots of RabbitMQ nodes) that the number of synchronized mirrors matches the
number of RabbitMQ nodes in your cluster. To do so, check the RabbitMQ web 
console at `<https://api-int.osism.local:15672>`_ in the queues tab. The number
of synchronized mirror (blue icon with a +<number>) should match the number of
RabbitMQ nodes minus one (the master for that queue). So on a three node
RabbitMQ cluster there should be a ``+2`` icon for each queue.

How to fix missing mirrors
--------------------------

If you miss a mirror (so in the above example, if you only see a +1 on certain
queues) there is a workaround possible to restore the missing mirrors.

Create a new ``ha-all`` policy with a priority of ``1`` and assign it to all
queues. That should add the missing mirrored queues. After that you can remove
the policy again and the queues fall back to their default ``ha-all`` policy.

The screenshot shows the settings on how to do this via the web console.
